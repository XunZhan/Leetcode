### The Stack
In the stack, there are:  
- Method Invocations
- Local Variables: Local variables are declared inside a method, including method parameters. They’re temporary, and live only as long as the method is on the stack (in other words, as long as the method has not reached the closing curly brace).  


### The Heap
In the heap, there are:  
- Objects
- Instance Variables: Instance variables are declared inside a class but not inside a method. They represent the “fields” that each individual object has (which can be filled with different values for each instance of the class). Instance variables live inside the object they belong to.
